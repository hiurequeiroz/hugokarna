      <description>Motivation Testing routers with the latest version of LibreMesh is crucial for community networks that rely on mesh networks as their communication infrastructure. The significance lies in the fact that insufficient testing hinders the development of newer versions. Currently, the official version of LibreMesh is tied to the 2019 release of OpenWRT. This limitation impedes progress, as advancements and improvements are often left unexplored. By conducting thorough tests with the most recent version, we pave the way for enhanced features, increased stability, and better overall performance.</description>

      <title>Como fazer o pão selvagem</title>

      <description>Uma das coisas que mais me deixa feliz é fazer pão. Gosto muito de mergulhar nas profundezas das proteínas e imaginar cada ligação química que pode estar sendo feita ou desfeita durante o processo. Para fazer pão eu entendi ao londo do tempo que é necessário paciência para chegar num resultado satisfatório. Paciência tanto para esperar o momento certo de fazer algo, de deixar que a química aconteça e também paciência para testar farinhas e achar o melhor fornecedor.</description>

      <description>Draft Project This project proposes the development of an innovative framework for creating social technology aimed at low-income communities and/or family farmers preferably associated with community networks. The main objective is to design a technological matrix that includes a form of low-power analog communication between sensors. This communication will be enabled through the use of sustainable energy technologies, such as thermoelectric generators (TEGs) and water-activated paper batteries.&#xA;The inclusion of these communities in community network ecosystems is essential, as these networks provide a collaborative environment and knowledge exchange, allowing communities to access groups involved in the connectivity process in their territories.</description>

      <description>As the creator of Sítio do Astronauta, a collective of artists, activists, and researchers working with free and community technologies, I bring my academic experience in science and my learning in reverse engineering as a hacktivist. Realizing the gap between academia and society, I decided to create this collective to communicate and bring science and technology to communities in a different way. Sítio do Astronauta was conceived not only from my vision of exploring the frontiers of technology and art but also with the essential collaboration of Marcela Guerra.</description>
