## ESP32

The ESP32 is a prototyping platform with a microcontroller, similar to [Arduino](/posts/arduino), but with higher performance in applications involving wifi and low power consumption. It represents an evolution of the well-known ESP8266, offering greater processing capacity.

The ESP32 is a System on a Chip (SOC) that integrates a microcontroller, wifi, and bluetooth BLE. Developed by Espressif Systems, the ESP32 has interesting features, such as:

The board contains the ESP32 chip with a built-in antenna, a usb-serial interface, and a 3.3V voltage regulator. Programming can be done in LUA or using the Arduino IDE with a micro-usb cable. With 4 MB of flash memory, the ESP32 enables the creation of various applications for IoT projects, remote access, web servers, and data loggers, among others.
