Passionate about learning new things, I graduated in Physics and pursued my academic career by doing a master's degree in [Materials Science at the Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ITA)](http://bdtd.ibict.br/vufind/Record/ITA_69f67f8b7750867feb8cadadb08d454f) and later starting my PhD in Physics, I realized that my life was more related to communities than academia.
I followed my dream of working with technologies and founded the [Astronaut's Site - Art and Technology LTDA](/../projects/sitiodoastronauta), a collective for the study and development of science and technologies that drive learning experiences and artistic expression. Always aiming to reconcile artisanal techniques, simple materials, and electronics to enhance the construction of objects with accessible technologies, meeting the needs focused on self-development and collective work, a good example is the [cardboard house with solar energy](https://sitiodoastronauta.com.br/vila-solar-casa-de-papelao-fotovoltaica/). The collective became popular through the promotion of seminars and workshops inspired by the do-it-yourself culture.

This led to one of the projects I like the most, Tecnomisticismo made in partnership with the [Sesc 2017 arts circuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tkY-XSw-0), which seeks to bring technology through a language of symbols and everything that surrounds different mystical ideas. Technology is used to create an environment of immersion and reflection on what technology is and how it can be used to create learning experiences and artistic expression.

In the middle of 2015, I participated in the Nuvem Art and Technology Station, the [Fumaça Data Springs](https://wiki.nuvem.tk/index.php/Fuma%C3%A7a_Data_Springs) project for creating the first mesh wifi network and an experimental network in the GSM band in Vila da Fumaça, Resende-RJ. Next, I joined a group and founded the [coolab](https://coolab.org), a group for research and development of free and open technologies, focusing on community networks, communication technologies, and art.

As part of one of coolab's projects, we founded the [Portal sem Porteiras Association](/../projects/psp), a non-profit association that seeks to promote digital inclusion and technological autonomy for rural and urban communities through free and open technologies, based in Bairro dos Souzas, Monteiro Lobato-SP.
