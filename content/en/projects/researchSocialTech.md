## Draft Project 

This project proposes the development of an innovative framework for creating social technology aimed at low-income communities and/or family farmers preferably associated with community networks. The main objective is to design a technological matrix that includes a form of low-power analog communication between sensors. This communication will be enabled through the use of sustainable energy technologies, such as thermoelectric generators (TEGs) and water-activated paper batteries.

The inclusion of these communities in community network ecosystems is essential, as these networks provide a collaborative environment and knowledge exchange, allowing communities to access groups involved in the connectivity process in their territories. This integration strengthens community participation in the development and implementation of the proposed technological solutions, ensuring that they truly meet their needs and local contexts.

The proposed framework will be developed in a participatory manner, involving communities from the initial conception phase to the implementation and evaluation of the technological systems. Aspects such as cost, ease of maintenance, and environmental impact will be considered to ensure the viability and sustainability of the proposed solutions.

The integration of harvest energy technologies such as TEGs and paper batteries that can be controlled by the new "Nano-Power Management" line of charge controllers will enable the creation of autonomous and low-cost systems, reducing dependence on traditional energy sources and facilitating deployment in remote or hard-to-reach areas, where community networks can play a crucial role in the dissemination and maintenance of these technologies.

At the end of the project, it is expected to provide an open and accessible framework that can be adapted and implemented by non-governmental organizations, research institutions, and social enterprises interested in developing technological solutions for low-income communities. This initiative has the potential to promote digital and energy inclusion, contributing to the reduction of social inequalities and sustainable development at a local and global scale.
