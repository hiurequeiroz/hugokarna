As the creator of [Sítio do Astronauta](http://sitiodoastronauta.com.br), a collective of artists, activists, and researchers working with free and community technologies, I bring my academic experience in science and my learning in reverse engineering as a hacktivist. Realizing the gap between academia and society, I decided to create this collective to communicate and bring science and technology to communities in a different way.
Sítio do Astronauta was conceived not only from my vision of exploring the frontiers of technology and art but also with the essential collaboration of [Marcela Guerra](http://guerradimarcela.net.br). Together, we created a space where innovation and creativity come together to generate unique experiences. With a strong foundation in free and community technologies, the collective is dedicated to developing playful electronic activities that not only entertain but also educate.

Through the activities of Sítio do Astronauta, I seek to awaken curiosity and interest in science and technology, encouraging experimentation and self-taught learning. The playful electronic activities we propose are carefully designed to introduce concepts of electronics, programming, and robotics in an accessible and engaging way.

In addition to promoting technological education, one of the goals of Sítio do Astronauta is to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing. I believe that by working together and sharing experiences, it is possible to create innovative solutions to society's challenges. Therefore, I make sure that Sítio do Astronauta is an inclusive space where people of all ages and backgrounds can come together to learn, create, and innovate.

In summary, Sítio do Astronauta, more than a collective, is a vibrant community that seeks, through playful and learning-filled electronic activities, to inspire a new generation of creators, thinkers, and innovators, all under my leadership and vision of bringing science and technology closer to society in a more accessible and engaging way.
