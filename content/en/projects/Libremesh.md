## Libremesh


In the realm of open-source community networks, LibreMesh stands out as an essential tool for building autonomous and decentralized network infrastructures. Recently, the LibreMesh community made an exciting announcement, revealing the release of new versions aligned with the latest updates from OpenWrt. This development marks a crucial step in keeping pace with the rapid evolution of the network hardware market.

The significance of this update cannot be underestimated, especially in an environment where new hardware versions are constantly being introduced. Older versions of OpenWrt, on which LibreMesh was previously based, may not provide support for the latest devices. Consequently, updating LibreMesh becomes essential to ensure compatibility with the most recent hardware, enabling communities to make the most of emerging technologies.

In this dynamic scenario, my role in this project is to facilitate a smooth transition to the new versions of LibreMesh. As an integral part of the community, I am involved in disseminating information about the updates, providing technical support, and collaborating with other members to address challenges and optimize the performance of community networks. By sharing knowledge and experiences, I contribute to strengthening and expanding the community network infrastructure, empowering communities to tackle the challenges posed by constantly evolving hardware standards.
