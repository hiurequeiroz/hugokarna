## Lokal

I played a crucial role in the Lokal project, focusing on the installation and configuration of Libremesh on the routers to establish a robust mesh network. This setup was essential for ensuring the seamless operation of Lokal within a mesh network environment. For detailed technical insights into this aspect of the project, please refer to [this link](/posts/libremeshlokal/).
